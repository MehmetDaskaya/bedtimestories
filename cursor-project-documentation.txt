BedTimeStories Project Documentation
Overview
BedTimeStories is a React Native application for reading, creating, and managing children's stories. It features user authentication, a story library, story creation, and user profile management. The app uses React Navigation for navigation, React Native Paper for UI components, and (optionally) Firebase for authentication and data storage.

Main App Flow
App.tsx wraps the app in providers (PaperProvider, SafeAreaProvider, AuthProvider) and sets up navigation.
Navigation is handled via a Drawer for main app screens and a Stack for authentication screens.
Authentication is managed via a custom AuthContext (with optional Firebase integration).

Navigation
DrawerNavigator: Main app navigation (Home, Library, Create, Profile, Settings, StoryPage).
AuthStackNavigator: Authentication flow (SignIn, SignUp, ForgotPassword).
CustomDrawer: Custom drawer UI.

Screens
HomeScreen: Main landing page after login.
LibraryScreen: Browse and search stories.
CreateStoryScreen: Create a new story.
StoryPageScreen: Read a selected story.
ProfileScreen: User profile and settings.
SettingsScreen: App settings.
Authentication Screens: SignIn, SignUp, ForgotPassword.

Components
AppHeader: Top navigation/header bar.
Categories: Story categories UI.
FeaturedStories: Carousel or list of featured stories.
PlayBackControls: Audio playback controls.
StoryCard: Card UI for a story.
StoryCarousel: Carousel for stories.

Context
AuthContext: Provides authentication state and methods (sign in, sign out, etc.) to the app.

Data
data.json: Static or sample story data.

Authentication
Firebase is no longer used.
Auth state is managed in AuthContext.
Auth screens use context methods for sign in, sign up, and password reset.

Styling
Uses React Native Paper for UI components.
Custom styles are defined in each component or screen
